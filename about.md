Hi there! 

My name is Matthijs. I am a software developer and tech lead working for a Dutch consultancy firm.

Over the years I have worked on numerous projects for companies that operate in all kinds of branches.
Although some concepts were the same on every project, somehow we started empty-handed every time.
After experiencing this multiple times, I made it my goal to break this cycle and make sure that work and knowledge is reusable without me having to be directly involved.

And that's where this website comes in! Over here I will be posting articles about all kinds of programming concepts that I use myself and might be interesting for others!

Happy reading!
